# OpenCosmosChallenge
This repository contains my proposal to the OpenCosmos challenge.
It also contains a brief report "OC_report_Alejandro_de_Miguel" to summarize the thought process and approach when facing the challenge, and with the intentions to clarify and explain the code, assumptions and results.

There are several files, being main_OC.py the file to be executed.

I appreciate any positive or negative feedback that makes me improve!
