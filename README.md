# OpenCosmosChallenge
This repository contains my proposal to the OpenCosmos challenge.
It also contains a brief report to summarize the thought process and approach when facing the challenge, and with the intentions to clarify and explain the code, assumptions and results.

There are several files, being main_OC.py the file to be executed.

I appreciate any positive or negative feedback that makes me improve!
